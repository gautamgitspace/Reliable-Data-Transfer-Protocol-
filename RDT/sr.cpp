/* ******************************************************************
 ALTERNATING BIT AND GO-BACK-N NETWORK EMULATOR: VERSION 1.1  J.F.Kurose

   This code should be used for PA2, unidirectional data transfer 
   protocols (from A to B). Network properties:
   - one way network delay averages five time units (longer if there
     are other messages in the channel for GBN), but can be larger
   - packets can be corrupted (either the header or the data portion)
     or lost, according to user-defined probabilities
   - packets will be delivered in the order in which they were sent
     (although some can be lost).
