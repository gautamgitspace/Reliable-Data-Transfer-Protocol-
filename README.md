# Reliable-Data-Transfer-Protocol-
The protocol is programmed at Transport Layer in C++ to send and receive data reliably.
The implementation will implement three versions (Go-Back-N, Alternating-Bit-Protocol and Selective Repeat Protocol) 
of pipelined protocols, which will be transmitting data at L4. Involves performance comparison of throughput of the
three protocols using different window sizes and loss probabilities.
